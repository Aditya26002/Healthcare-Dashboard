**This project is a healthcare dashboard application that allows users to submit their name, age, and upload a file. The information is then sent to a backend server for processing.**

**Technologies Used**

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Flask, Python

**Features**

- User-friendly interface for entering name, age, and uploading files
- Secure file upload functionality
- Communication between frontend and backend using API calls
- Backend processing of submitted data (implementation details can be added here)

**Getting Started**

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    - Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
    - Python 3 installed on your system.

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aditya26002/Healthcare-Dashboard.git
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    - Frontend:

      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm install
      ```

    - Backend:

      ```bash
      cd backend
      pip install
      ```

4.  **Run the application:**

    - Frontend:

      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm start
      ```

      This will start the frontend development server on port 3000 by default. You can access the application at http://localhost:3000.

    - Backend:

      ```bash
      cd backend
      python app.py
      ```

      This will start the backend server on port 5000 by default. You can test the API endpoint using tools like Postman.
